      <description>All volumes of the Field Expedient SDR series are available on [Amazon Canada] (http://www.amazon.ca) in paperback and Kindle formats. The paperbacks are available with a black and white interior as well as a full-color interior. Because the gnuradio interface color-codes some of its elements, there is additional value in the color versions. Unfortunately, the printing costs of full-color books are much more expensive, so we&amp;rsquo;ve also provided the more affordable black-and-white versions.</description>
